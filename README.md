[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

**WDSM** (Weighted Double Score Matching) is a statistical method for causal inference from complex survey observational data. This method integrates survey weights into matching analysis by combining propensity and prognostic scores, providing robust estimation of treatment effects while properly accounting for complex survey design.

## Key Features

- **Double Robustness**: Achieves consistency when either the population-level propensity or prognostic score model is correctly specified with survey-weighted estimation
- - **Survey Weight Integration**: Properly incorporates survey weights throughout the double score estimation and matching process
  - - **Multiple Estimands**: Supports estimation of both Population Average Treatment Effects (PATE) and Treatment Effects on the Treated (PATT)
    - - **Flexible Sampling**: Handles both retrospective sampling (selection depends on treatment) and prospective sampling (treatment-independent selection)
      - - **Reduced Bias**: Substantially reduces bias compared to unweighted methods under informative retrospective sampling
       
        - ## Background
       
        - Double score matching is an emerging method for causal inference that achieves dimension reduction and model robustness by combining propensity and prognostic scores. However, existing implementations assume simple random sampling, which limits their applicability to complex survey observational data where valid population inference requires the proper incorporation of survey weights.
       
        - WDSM extends double score matching to complex survey data by:
        - 1. Incorporating survey weights in score estimation
          2. 2. Adapting the matching procedure for weighted data
             3. 3. Providing valid inference under complex survey designs
               
                4. ## Method
               
                5. Under the weighted matching framework, WDSM provides a unified solution for incorporating survey weights throughout the double score estimation and matching process. The method:
               
                6. - Derives estimators for PATE and PATT under different sampling schemes
                   - - Establishes consistency and asymptotic normality
                     - - Maintains double robustness property in the survey-weighted setting
                       - - Provides superior robustness to model misspecification compared to single-score survey-weighted alternatives
                        
                         - ## Applications
                        
                         - WDSM is particularly useful for:
                         - - Analyzing observational data from national health surveys (e.g., NHANES)
                           - - Causal inference studies with complex survey designs
                             - - Population-level treatment effect estimation from stratified, clustered samples
                               - - Studies where valid population inference is required from non-representative samples
